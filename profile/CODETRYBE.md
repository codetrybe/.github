# CodeTrybe

## Brief History

CodeTrybe is a community of software engineers and would-be software engineers founded by [Topman Paul-Dike](https://github.com/tpauldike) a few months after he enrolled for the ALX Software Engineering program. As a complete newbie in tech., he saw the necessity of having a group of like minded fellows come today to make Peer Learning work, so as to reduce the level of frustration and confusion among ALX SE students, by employing certain strategies, such as;
- revisiting formal projects to really understand the basic concepts and resolve some of the tasks more confidently
- making peers courageous enough to take Peer Learning Sessions as intended by ALX, even while still learning the concept
- keeping peers motivated and bringing out the best in them

and so on.

CodeTrybe kept growing and growing and Topman, by his visionary leadership, was able to attract men and women of like mind and get some fellows inspired and motivated to become a part of the vision and not just part of the community, CodeTrybe. By the time of this documentation, CodeTrybe had grown into a huge community of people who love to do hard things, including non-ALX students, with two official YouTube channels - [Topman's Personal Channel](https://youtube.com/@tpauldike) and [CodeTrybe Channel](https://youtube.com/@codetrybe) - where very resourceful materials and recordings of live sessions and guides are uploaded to, with the intention of making anyone believe that he can do hard things if he tries.

The vision kept expanding and the ***beyond 12 months*** dream of the founder became a great possibilty and so acheivable. This level of growth made it necessary for the vision, plan and structure to be documented for proper communication to those who will love to really be part of it now and in the future, in order not to deviate from the main purpose.

## Community Structure

CodeTrybe had, by this time, the following structure:

### A. Offices

1. President
2. Vice President
3. Treasurer
4. Secretary
5. Financial Secretary
6. Media/Publicity Manager
7. Project Manager
8. Public Relation Officer

Some of the persons who occupy these offices double as *cohort leaders* and they are referred to as **CodeTrybe Officials** or **Reserved Team** members.

### B. Leadership Hierarchy
- President
    - Vice President
        - CodeTrybe Officials/Cohort Leaders
            - Resource Persons/Special Duties
                - Members (the most important persons in the structure)
                - External groups

### C. Social Media Communities

#### 1. General Communities:
- A **general community** for annoucements, where only community admins can post and reach out to all other WhatsApp groups at once.
- A **Telegram space** that is opened to all members of CodeTrybe, and intended members as well.

#### 2. Special Groups:
- **Reserved Team** - The team for CodeTrybe officials and cohort leaders, saddled with community-wide administrative responsibilities. This is where the decisions are taken that run the community.
- **CodeTrybe Main Team** - The team for those who are committed and confident enough to be actively involed in real life projects (non-ALX portfolio projects to help us learn more) and build much more confidence.

#### 3. Resource Persons/Special Duties
These groups make things easier for the community to be efficient and more effective, Special duties include those who volunteer to be posting updates and reminders in the particular cohort. They are all resourceful, whether or not they take classes.
- **Squads** - The team for those in ALX who are very courageous to voluteer as resource persons to lead their mates, especially in Peer Learning Sessions
- **Rescue Teams** - For students of ALX SE who want to help *younger* cohorts by organizing taking them in classes.

#### 4. Peer Groups
- **Cohort Groups** - The WhatsApp groups for each respective cohorts of ALX SE students but opened to persons from other cohorts and non-ALX students as well.
- **External Groups** - CodeTrybe couldn't help accepting external bodies who wanted to be part of CodeTrybe without loosing their name, so they had their WhatsApp groups added to the CodeTrybe group, from where they are free to join any cohort group and can access general information.
- **Intended CodeTrybe Members** - This is another interesting WhatsApp group that serves as the *gate to CodeTrybe*; it is the group whose link is being shared (like our Telegram link) to the public. All that happens here is that we greet new members, ask them to identify there respective cohorts, and then redirect them to their respective cohorts.

Non-ALX SE students who join are encouraged to identify with any cohort at random and join the general events or classes, and they usually end up enrolling for the ALX SE program.

### Peer Learning Days
These activities are geered towards helping the students of ALX SE who come in contact with CodeTrybe to find the **hard things** doable and learn on a daily basis in a way that will make the individual appreciate being a member of CodeTrybe while in the ALX SE program. It fosters the ALX model of Peer Learning.
