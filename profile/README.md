# CodeTrybe

## Welcoming Note

Welcome to **CodeTrybe** community. A vibrant community of young techies learning together. This community is a brain child of [Topman Paul-Dike](https://github.com/tpauldike). We as a community aim at being inclusive to all types of developers. All are welcome in the community.

## History

CodeTrybe is a community of Software Engineers from different cohorts in **ALX SE** who came together for very purpose of learning together as peers and helping one another understand basic concepts and as well tackle past and present projects together. CodeTrybe was founded by [Topman Paul-Dike](https://github.com/tpauldike), who came up with the initiative to help trainees curtail the frustrating experiences that we (especially novices) face in the **ALX SE** program. Being heavily supported by some young men and women of like mind, the Community blossomed beyond what **Topman** could have achieved alone. [Ebube Anyanwu](https://github.com/ebu-be) was the first support that **Topman** ever had, and then others showed up.
