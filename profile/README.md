Welcome to the CodeTrybe Community, a thriving hub where young tech enthusiasts come together to learn and grow. Our community, founded by the visionary [Topman Paul-Dike](https://github.com/tpauldike), is dedicated to fostering inclusivity and providing support for developers of all levels. Whether you're a seasoned professional or just starting your journey, you are warmly welcomed here.

## History

CodeTrybe is a community of Software Engineers from different cohorts in **ALX SE** who came together for very purpose of learning together as peers and helping one another understand basic concepts and as well tackle past and present projects together. CodeTrybe was founded by [Topman Paul-Dike](https://github.com/tpauldike), who came up with the initiative to help trainees curtail the frustrating experiences that we (especially novices) face in the **ALX SE** program. Being heavily supported by some young men and women of like mind, the Community blossomed beyond what **Topman** could have achieved alone. [Ebube Anyanwu](https://github.com/ebu-be) was the first support that **Topman** ever had, and then others showed up.
